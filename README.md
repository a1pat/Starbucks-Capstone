# Free Starbucks Cappucino, Anyone? #
This a Capstone project for the Udacity Datascience Nanodegree program.

## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a> ##
Starbucks would like to know how its Rewards mobile app users respond to various promotional offers. Who is likely to make a purchase in response to an advertisement? Or a discount offer? Or a BOGO (buy one get one free)? Who is likely to make a purchase even if they don't receive an offer? 

This project seeks to answer the following specific questions:
1. Grouping of customers
2. Which are the most popular offers? Do some offers resonate with certain customer segments? Are there any offers that don't excite anybody? 
3. How well can a model predict which offers are likely to be well received?
4. Do any customer groups make purchase even if there are no offers?
