## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a> ##
Starbucks would like to know how its Rewards mobile app users (customers) respond to various promotional offers. Who is likely to make a purchase in response to an advertisement? Or a discount offer? Or a BOGO (buy one get one free)? Who is likely to make a purchase even if they don't receive an offer? 

This project seeks to answer the following specific questions:
1. Grouping of customers
2. Which are the most popular offers? Do some offers resonate with certain customer segments? Are there any offers that don't excite anybody? 
3. How well can a model predict which offers are likely to be well received?
4. Do any customer groups make purchase even if there are no offers?

## Data Exploration ##

### Types of Offers<a name="types_of_offers"></a> ###
Ten different types of offers are included in the study. Two of the offers are **informational** in nature. Completing an informational offer does not attract any specific reward. The project instructions state that an informational offers can be assumed to be 'influential' for a specified length of time once the app receives the offer. This could be debated - it would be more likely that the influence lasts for a certain period once the the user views the offer. Nevertheless, the project instruction has been honored in this analysis.

There are four of **discount** offers, differing in the minimum amount of money required to be spent (refered to as **difficulty**) to earn a reward, the amount of reward (refered to as **reward**) and the validity period (refered to as **duration**) of the offer.

Finally, there are four **bogo** (buy one get one free) offers. These, vary in difficulty and duration. The reward for a bogo offer is, of course, the same as the diffuculty.

![Offer Attributes Summary](images/offer_summary.png)

Each offer is made to customers through one or more channels (mobile, social, web, email). The mobile app data available is available, per the project instructions. Accordingly, channel effects are not considered in this analysis.

### Customer Demographics <a name="customer_demographics"></a> ###
The customer data set includes 17,000 mobile app customers. Age, income and gender are available for 14,825 customers (missing for 2,175 - approximately 13% - of all customers), while the membership date is available for all customers in the data set.

As seen below, almost all customers identify as either **F** or **M** gender. A very small portion of customers (1.4%) identify as **O** gender. The numbers of **F** and **M** customers is comparable and should not affect models based on gender, *but the very small fraction of **O** customers could cause models to ignore any age/income/membership year relationships characteristic of the **O** gender.*
![Gender Distribution](images/gender_distribution.png)

The age distributions for both **F** and **M** customers are skewed to the left. Further, there are relatively more **M** customers in the lower age and income groups than **F** customers.

![Age Distribution by Gender](images/age_gender_boxplot.png)
![Income Distribution by Gender](images/income_gender_boxplot.png)

Most of the customers in the study (63%) became (Rewards club) members in 2017 and 2018. The number of joiners declines rapidly as we go back in time. *Consequently, models may perform better with later joiners than early joiners.* Age, income and gender are missing for 4% of customers who became members in 2013 and 2014 and for roughly 13% of customers who joined after 2014. This is expected to slightly restore some balance. The lower number of 2018 joiners is presumably because the study was conducted in mid 2018.
![Membership Year Distribution](images/membership_year_distribution.png)

Crossplots show behavior that may point to data collection issues:

![Income versus Age](images/income_versus_age_scatter.png)
![Income by Membership Year](images/income_by_year_boxplot.png)

The stair-step behavior of maximum income versus age is strange. While younger customers may well have lower average income is lower, their income distribution would probably have some samples in higher income ranges. Is it due to how the customer set was chosen for the study? The box plot shows no customers who signed up in 2013 and 2014 had income above $100,000. Perhaps the membership application did not provide the option to indicate a higher income? While the reasons for this unexpected behavior are not known with certainty, it could certainly impact model performance.

### Transaction Data <a name="transaction_data"></a> ###
Data for 306,534 transactions is provided in the transcript.json file. A transaction is a record of a purchase made via the app, or a record of an offer being received, viewed or completed via the app. A total of 76,277 offers were sent to 17,000 customers. Most customers received at least five offers, while some customers received as many as six offers. Each customer received at least one offer. Approximately 7,600 of each of the ten types of offers were sent out. Each offer was sent (received) at each of the following times: 0, 168, 336, 408, 504 and 576 though not to each customer. The last transaction is timestamped 714 - this is the end of the test, but not all offers expired by this time. Thus, some offers may have been viewed and completed after the test ended, and were not necessarily unsuccessful. In fact, each offer could have one of the outcomes shown in the following figure:
![Outcomes](images/outcome_tree.png)

The outcomes are defined as follows:
1. Successful: the offer is viewed before completion, and completed before expiration;
2. Unsuccessful: the offer is viewed but not completed before expiration; expiration is within the duration of the test;
3. Inconclusive: the offer is viewed but not completed within the test period; expiration is after the end of the test period;
4. Lost: the offer was not viewed within the test period;
5. Uncolicited: this is actually not an outcome of a received offer, but a purchase unrelated to an offer.
Classifying each offer/transaction according to the above scheme is important for assessing each offer. *It is also time consuming.* A flag (**read_saved_person_offer**) in the code can be set to True the first time the code is run to perform the categorization. The results are saved to a pickle file. The flag can be set to False during subsequent runs - this reads the categorization from the pickle file and saves time.

## Demographic Groups<a name="demographic_groups"></a> ##
Customer data (from profile.json) were analyzed to determine if there were any natural demographic groups. Missing rows were dropped and all the remaining rows were used for this analysis. The goal was not to predict the group of future/unknown customers, hence separation into training and test sets was necessary. Such separation may be required in future if such prediction is contemplated.

Two popular methods are used to determine groups - PCA and K-Means, both using the scikit-learn package.

The following featue set is employed: ['age','income','M','F','O','became_member_year']. 'M', 'F' and 'O' are categorical variables derived from *gender*. 'became_member_year' is derived from 'became_member_on'.

PCa The scikit-learn package is used for both.
