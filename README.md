## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a> ##
Starbucks is interested in knowing how its Rewards mobile app users respond to various promotional offers. Who is likely to make a purchase in response to an advertisement, a discount offer, a BOGO (buy one get one free)? Who is likely to make a purchase even if there is no promotion?

## Problem Statement<a name="problem_statement"></a> ##

This project seeks to answer the following specific questions:
1. What are the customer demographics? What are the natural customer groups?
2. Which are the most popular promotional offers? Do some offers resonate more with certain customer segments? Are there any offers that donâ€™t excite anybody?
3. How well can a model predict which offers are likely to be well received?

## Summary of Analysis<a name="summary_of_analysis"></a> ##
1. There are three sets of data - offer data, customer data and transaction data. The analysis starts with understanding the data: variable distributions, inter-variable relationships, and any data-related issues.
2. Prelimary exploration is followed by more in-depth understanding of customer data using PCA and K-Means clustering.
3. Transaction data is processed to categorize the outcome of each instance of each offer as either successful, unsuccessful, inconclusive, unsolicited or lost. The categorization is combined with customer data and offer parameters to determine what drives an offer's success rate.
4. Finally classification models are developed to predict the outcome of an offer as a function of customer attributes. A global model is developed to predict the outcomes for a new type of offer.

## Summary of Results<a name="summary_of_results"></a> ##
1. Eight data issues were identified during preliminary data exploration. These have the potential to create biases in the model. It is not possible to resolve these with available information. We caveat and proceed. A nonth issue related to incorrect labeling of completed offers was identified and addressed by re-labeling the completion transactions.
2. PCA and K_Means reveal that gender is the main differentiating attribute among customers. Further distinction can be made along age, income and membership year lines.
3. The most successful offers are found to have been sent using all of email mobile and social channels. Not surprisingly, income is the customer attribute that determines whether a customer completes an offer. Income is confounded with age, gender (F gender age and income are skewed to the high side while M gender age and income are skewed to the low side).
4. DecisionTree classifiers are fit to each offer and to a "global" data set. Classifier parameters are tuned using GridSearch. The accuracy metric for the **test set** is generally around 0.65 or higher which is considered acceptable. Optimal classifier parameters are obtained.

## File Descriptions<a name="file_descriptions"></a> ##
The following files and folders are in the root folder:
+ **data** (folder)
    + **portfolio.json**: offer data.
    + **profile.json**: customer demographic data.
    + **transcript.zip**: transcript data in json format, zipped due to GitHub file size limitations. Unzip this file before use.
+ **README.md**: this file.
+ **Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb**: python code for the entire analysis.
+ **pic1.png**: image inserted into Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb.
+ **pic2.png**: image inserted into Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb.

## Libraries/Packages<a name="libraries_packages"></a> ##
The following python packages are used:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. json
4. matplotlib
5. tqdm
6. sklearn

## Instructions for Use<a name="instructions_for_use"></a> ##
1. Download all the files in the [File Descriptions](#file_descriptions) section to your computer preserving the folder structure;
2. Unzip the **transcript.zip** file. You should now have a **transcript.json** file in your **data** folder.
3. Open the **Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb** file. There is a variable called **read_saved_categorization** in the second code cell. Make sure this variable is set to **False** the first time you read the notebook. This will cause some time-consuming calculations to be run the first time. Intermediate results from these time-consuming calculations (specifically, the **df_all_person_offer** pandas data frame) will be stored to a file named **df_all_person_offer.pkl** in the same folder as the notebook. For subsequent runs, the **read_saved_categorization** variable can be set to **True**. This will cause the intermediate results to be read from the pickle file instead of re-running the time-consuming calculations, thus saving time. Of course, if you make changes to the notebook that affect the intermediate results (**df_all_person_offer**), you will need to set the **read_saved_categorization** variable to **False** for the next run.
